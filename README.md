# DESCRIPTION

In this **application** our **FILE-STRUCTURE** is based
on **MVC:MODELS VIEWS CONTROLLERS** .The
main function of **MVC** is easy to understand the file structure, easy to 
figure out where the **ERROR** is and where to go and fix it .By dividing applicationinto three logical parts, it's very easy for the **USERS** and 
other **DEVELOPERS** have a smooth walkthrough of code.

## GOOGLE-OAUTH2-LOGIN-AUTHENTICATION
It is the process of recognizing the user's identity or to identify the user 
at the computer when logged in.

## NPM-PACKAGES-USED-IN-NODE-AUTHENTICATION:-
 **Passport** :-Passport is Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js.Passport's main motive is to authenticate requests, which it does through   plugins known as strategies. We must provide Passport a request to authenticate, and it provides hooks for controlling what occurs when authentication is successfull or it fails. **Strategies** are used to authenticate requests. They should be  configured before authenticating requests.


 **passport-google-OAuth2**:-It lets you authenticate using Google in your Node.js applications.The Google OAuth 2.0 authentication strategy authenticates users using a **Google account** . The strategy requires a verify **callback**, which accepts these **credentials** and calls done providing a user, as well as options specifying a **client ID, client secret, and callback URL**.We have to access
 **GOOGLE DEVELOPER CONSOLE** in order to get **Id,SECRET and CALLBACK URL**.


 **express**:-In order to get express , it's important to install NODE.js and then express .It provides a small but fast tool for HTTP servers, making it a good answer for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs. 

 
 **COOKIE-SESSION**:-It is a simple cookie-based session middleware.
A user session can be stored in two main ways with cookies: on the server or on the client. This module stores the session data on the client within a cookie, while a module like express-session stores only a session identifier on the client within a cookie and stores the session data on the server, typically in a database.
